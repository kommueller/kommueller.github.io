*16/04/2021* /// **Presentations at this year's ICA conference** /// I will be presenting three papers at this year's (virtual) ICA conference which will take place from May 27th to May 31st: (1.) Estimation of Differential Implicit Media Bias (with Chung-Hong Chan, Adrian Rauchfleisch, Hartmut Wessler, and Katharina Ludwig), (2.) Right-Wing, Populist, Controlled by Foreign Powers? Manifestations of Partisanship in the Content Structures of German-Language Alternative News Media (with Rainer Freudenthaler), and (3.) Tracking Populist Alternative News Exposure: A Comparison of First- and Second-Order Election Periods (with Ruben Bach). Should you be interested in any of this work (and not attend the conference), feel free to give me a shout!

*09/02/2021* /// **New article out in JCMC: The impact of Internet and social media use on well-being** /// The *Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication*'s first issue of 2021 features an article which I co-authored with Christian Schemer (JGU Mainz, Germany), Philipp Masur (VU Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Stefan Geiß (NTNU Trondheim, Norway), and Svenja Schäfer (U Vienna, Austria). We used the "pairfam" data set (spanning over a period of nine years) to study the net effects of Internet and social media use on adolescents' well-being. Long story short: There are hardly any such effects in the aggregate, neither between nor within individuals. This result calls into question claims of a uniform malicious impact of the Internet in youth's lives. At the same time, it should be read as encouraging researchers to focus on differential effects in the future which might occur in specific sub-populations. The article can be found open access here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmaa014" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmaa014</a>

*15/10/2020* /// **Grant from the German Bundestag's Racism Monitor** /// In the upcoming months, I will be involved in a project that is part of the German Bundestag's Racism Monitor program which is coordinated by *Deutsches Zentrum für Integrations- und Migrationsforschung*. My Mannheim-based colleagues Chung-hong Chan, Katharina Ludwig, Hartmut Wessler and I submitted a proposal to investigate open and hidden racism in German media coverage. We were asked to join forces with the team of Alejandro Ecker, Michael Imre, and Marius Sältzer who proposed to study the same in the Twitter communication between politicians and citizens---which we happily did. We are looking forward to the collaboration, also with other project teams involved in the Racism Monitor who study similar questions.
