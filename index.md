*28/11/2022* /// **New book in memory of Wolfram Peiser is out: Questions of communicative change and continuity** /// Wolfram Peiser, who died far too young at the age of 58 last summer, was a hidden giant of the communication discipline. In the early 2000s, he published excessively and brilliantly on media use, media perceptions, and media change. Moreover, he was a great mentor to me and many others. To honor his intellectual legacy, Benjamin Krämer (LMU Munich) and I assembled his academic advisors, advisees, and companions. Together, we now published a volume on Wolfram's lifetime topic "Questions of Communicative Change and Continuity. In Memory of Wolfram Peiser" with *Nomos*. It is now available online as an <font color="#f36b2c">open access</font> e-book thanks to generous funding by the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Arts and the University of Mannheim Library: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5771/9783748928232" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.5771/9783748928232</a>

*23/11/2022* /// **Toot** /// Okay, okay. So you can now find me on Mastodon, too: <a href="https://sciences.social/@kommueller" target = "_blank">@kommueller@sciences.social</a>.

*03/11/2022* /// **ICA panel on measuring racism in automated content analyses accepted** /// Even before the actual submission deadline for next year's ICA conference, I had a first submission success. A panel on "Advancing Racism Research with Big Data?" I co-organized with SÜnje Paasch-Colberg (DeZIM, Berlin), Ahrabhi Kathirgamalingam (U Vienna), and Sean-Kelly Palicki (TU Munich) was selected to represent the German Communication Association (DGPuK) at the conference. In this association member panel, we will discuss the opportunities and pitfalls of measuring racist language in text using (semi-)automated methods. We are particularly glad that we were able to recruit Erik Bleich (Middlebury College) as a respondent. Erik is a true expert in the field. We are looking forward to discussing our research with him and the ICA crowd in Toronto next year.

*22/09/2022* /// **Teaching in the fall term** /// The fall term at U Mannheim is in full swing already. To me personally, after two years of emergency rule, this is the first term in a long time that feels "normal" in every way. And this is something I can greatly appreciate. I am looking forward to working with my wonderful students in my thesis colloquium and the following classes: (1) News Avoidance (B.A./M.A. seminar), (2) Researching Digital Communication: Methods, Tools, Designs (M.A. seminar), & (3) Advanced Data Analysis (M.A. seminar).

*15/07/2022* /// **Academic colloquium in memory of Wolfram Peiser** /// Today, the Department of Communication Studies and Media Research at LMU Munich (where I obtained my PhD) hosted an academic colloquium in memory of Wolfram Peiser. Wolfram was my PhD advisor in Munich and had a major impact on my academic work and the way I approach topics and research questions. I had the honor of chairing the event which included talks by the likes of Klaus Schönbach (ZU Friedrichshafen/U Amsterdam), Christina Holtz-Bacha (FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg), or Carsten Reinemann (LMU Munich). I am still deeply saddened about the passing of Wolfram Peiser in June 2021. He was a master of structuring a field of study in a manageable way without losing any of its complexity, and of developing sophisticated research designs that were so beyond any doubt that they could not easily be challenged.  A commemorative volume entitled **Questions of Communicative Change and Continuity** will appear later this year, edited by Benjamin Krämer (U Greifswald/LMU Munich) and myself. The book will be published by *Nomos* and will be available in an open-access version.

*07/04/2022* /// **New article out in Digital Journalism: Topic diversification and partisanship in the alternative news media market** /// In a study published today, Rainer Freudenthaler and I explored the content structures of German language alternative news media, with a special focus on two questions: 1.) Are right-wing populist partisanship (and ties to foreign countries and organizations) reflected in the outlets' content structures? (Short answer: right-wing populist partisanship clearly is, foreign relations are to some extent.) And: 2.) Is the alternative news market diversified with regards to content profiles? (Short answer: it is.) The full results are, of course, much more nuanced than these short answers. If you are interested in our analyses and their theoretical implications, feel free to read the article here: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/6GYZJWZZS5VRHDHWVZZT/full?target=10.1080/21670811.2022.2058972 " target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2022.2058972</a>

*01/02/2022* /// **New article out in NMS: The double-edged sword of online deliberation** /// A study I co-authored with Svenja Schäfer (U Vienna) & Marc Ziegele (HHU Düsseldorf) has just been published by *New Media and Society*. In this two-experiments open-access publication, we investigate the role evidence-based arguments within online debates play for discussion participation. Using mediation analysis, we can show that a higher argumentative quality of a given debate at the same time decreases and increases participation intent, resulting in a null total effect. This is due to the fact that evidence-based discussions strengthen participation via perceived knowledge and simultaneously buffer it via social comparison processes. If users read a high quality discussion they feel more knowledgable afterwards but at the same time inferior in comparison to the knowledge of others--which hinders an increase in willingness to participate. The full study can be found here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211073059" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211073059</a>
