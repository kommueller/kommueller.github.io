*28/11/2022* /// **New book in memory of Wolfram Peiser is out: Questions of communicative change and continuity** /// Wolfram Peiser, who died far too young in 2021, was a hidden giant of the communication discipline. In the early 2000s, he published excessively and brilliantly on media use, media perceptions, and media change. Moreover, he was a great mentor to me and many others. To honor his intellectual legacy, Benjamin Krämer (LMU Munich) and I assembled his academic advisors, advisees, and companions. Together, we now published a volume on Wolfram's lifetime topic "Questions of Communicative Change and Continuity. In Memory of Wolfram Peiser" with *Nomos*. It is now available as an <font color="#f36b2c">open access</font> e-book thanks to generous funding by the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Science, Research and Arts and the University of Mannheim Library: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5771/9783748928232" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.5771/9783748928232</a>

*03/11/2022* /// **ICA panel on measuring racism in automated content analyses accepted** /// Even before the actual submission deadline for next year's ICA conference, I had a first submission success. A panel on "Advancing Racism Research with Big Data?" I co-organized with SÜnje Paasch-Colberg (DeZIM, Berlin), Ahrabhi Kathirgamalingam (U Vienna), and Sean-Kelly Palicki (TU Munich) was selected to represent the German Communication Association (DGPuK) at the conference. In this association member panel, we will discuss the opportunities and pitfalls of measuring racist language in text using (semi-)automated methods. We are particularly glad that we were able to recruit Erik Bleich (Middlebury College) as a respondent. Erik is a true expert in the field. We are looking forward to discussing our research with him and the ICA crowd in Toronto next year.
