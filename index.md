*28/06/2021* /// **New article out in IJPOR: Inconsistent personalization and voting for populist candidates** /// Did you ever wonder whether obvious discrepancies between politicians' populist narratives and their own personal backgrounds (e.g., being rich or leading a cosmopolitan lifestyle) deter voters? Nora Denner (U Mainz) and I conducted experimental research that tests how personalized media portrayals of populists (outlining such inconsistencies) affect voting behavior. The article has just been published in the *International Journal of Public Opionion Research*: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edaa042" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edaa042</a>

*23/06/2021* /// **Passing of Wolfram Peiser** /// I am deeply saddened to learn that Wolfram Peiser passed away last Saturday, aged 58. As my PhD advisor and dedicated mentor throughout my first years in academia he had a major impact on my scientific work. He was a master of structuring a field of study in a manageable way without loosing any of its complexity, and of developing sophisticated research designs that were so beyond any doubt that they could not easily be challenged. I will always keep him in honorable memory.

*31/05/2021* /// **Tenure** /// As of June 1st, my position at U Mannheim will be tenured - which I am very happy about. I am not only sharing this fact here as a personal matter, but also because it has a political component. It has been discussed for quite some time now, that the German academic system has (in international comparison) a very small amount of researchers working on permanent contracts. It is oftentimes argued that the current academic system in Germany does not really allow to create permanent positions beyond the Associate/Full Professor levels. My case shows that this is only partly true. (Permanent Lecturer positions have, in fact, been much more common in past decades in German academia.) I have to cordially thank my department chairs Matthias Kohring, Peter Vorderer, & Hartmut Wessler for believing in this way and offering very fair conditions which allow me to continue combining research and teaching pari passu in the future.

*16/04/2021* /// **Presentations at this year's ICA conference** /// I will be presenting three papers at this year's (virtual) ICA conference which will take place from May 27th to May 31st: (1.) Estimation of Differential Implicit Media Bias (with Chung-Hong Chan, Adrian Rauchfleisch, Hartmut Wessler, and Katharina Ludwig), (2.) Right-Wing, Populist, Controlled by Foreign Powers? Manifestations of Partisanship in the Content Structures of German-Language Alternative News Media (with Rainer Freudenthaler), and (3.) Tracking Populist Alternative News Exposure: A Comparison of First- and Second-Order Election Periods (with Ruben Bach). Should you be interested in any of this work (and not attend the conference), feel free to give me a shout!

*09/02/2021* /// **New article out in JCMC: The impact of Internet and social media use on well-being** /// The *Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication*'s first issue of 2021 features an article which I co-authored with Christian Schemer (JGU Mainz, Germany), Philipp Masur (VU Amsterdam, the Netherlands), Stefan Geiß (NTNU Trondheim, Norway), and Svenja Schäfer (U Vienna, Austria). We used the "pairfam" data set (spanning over a period of nine years) to study the net effects of Internet and social media use on adolescents' well-being. Long story short: There are hardly any such effects in the aggregate, neither between nor within individuals. This result calls into question claims of a uniform malicious impact of the Internet in youth's lives. At the same time, it should be read as encouraging researchers to focus on differential effects in the future which might occur in specific sub-populations. The article has been published via open access: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmaa014" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/jcmc/zmaa014</a>
