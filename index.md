This page will give you an overview of my academic work. Most importantly, you can find links to open access publications and open materials complementing my research in the [publications list](./publications.html).

## Focus in Research & Teaching

* Political communication & populism
* News media, social identity, and societal cohesion
* Digital news consumption & its effects
* Social & psychological dynamics of media change & innovation
* Quantitative and computational methods (and their triangulation)

*14/12/2021* /// **End of term** /// Last week, the fall term of 2021 has come to an end. It was a quite busy time for me for two reasons: (1) My teaching load was slightly higher than before after being granted tenure and (2) we began to implement a number of new methods classes in the B.A. and M.A. programs in Media and Communication Studies at U Mannheim in the development of which I played a leading role. In total, I taught four classes: (1) a new methods introduction for first-year undergrad students (together with Rainer Freudenthaler), (2) an intro class to digital communication research methods for first-year grad students, (3) a class on automated media content analysis for students of the interdisciplinary M.A. program *Mannheim Master in Data Science* as well as (4) a research colloquium for my B.A. candidates. After a wonderful term with engaged students, I am now really happy about the short teaching break until February - and do hope, of course, that the pandemic will allow us to attend classes in person to a much greater extent next year than it did this year.

*02/08/2021* /// **New article out in NMS: Populist alternative news use and its role for elections** /// This is out just in time before the 2021 German *Bundestag* Election: In a web-tracking and survey study, Ruben Bach and I investigated the prevalence and origins of populist alternative news use during the 2017 *Bundestag* Election and the 2019 European Parliamentary Election and its relationship with populist voting. We find that only a specific part of the electorate is exposed to such outlets at all, but that this is strongly related to voting for right-wing populist *AfD*. Moreover, our analyses show that *Facebook* is the most important intermediary for referring users to populist alternative news. Importantly, this by far exceeds the role *Facebook* plays as an intermediary for legacy news exposure. The article has just been published in *New Media and Society* and is available via open-access: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211032969" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211032969</a>

*28/06/2021* /// **New article out in IJPOR: Inconsistent personalization and voting for populist candidates** /// Did you ever wonder whether obvious discrepancies between politicians' populist narratives and their own personal backgrounds (e.g., being rich or leading a cosmopolitan lifestyle) deter voters? Nora Denner (U Mainz) and I conducted experimental research that tests how personalized media portrayals of populists (outlining such inconsistencies) affect voting behavior. The article has just been published in the *International Journal of Public Opionion Research*: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edaa042" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edaa042</a>

*23/06/2021* /// **Passing of Wolfram Peiser** /// I am deeply saddened to learn that Wolfram Peiser passed away last Saturday, aged 58. As my PhD advisor and dedicated mentor throughout my first years in academia he had a major impact on my scientific work. He was a master of structuring a field of study in a manageable way without losing any of its complexity, and of developing sophisticated research designs that were so beyond any doubt that they could not easily be challenged. I will always keep him in honorable memory.
