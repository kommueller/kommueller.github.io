## News

*04/06/2020* /// **Chapter on populism in the news media published** /// Another publication from the very productive NCCR democracy project on populism in political communication has been published. In the chapter "Populist communication in the news media: The role of cultural and journalistic factors in ten democracies" we compare the occurrence of populist arguments in legacy news outlets of ten democracies and try to explain observable differences by cultural and journalistic factors. The chapter was published in a book by Christina Holtz-Bacha and Benjamin Krämer (*Perspectives on Populism and the Media*) which can be found <a href="https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/9783845297392/perspectives-on-populism-and-the-media" target="_blank">here</a>.

*07/04/2020* /// **Virtual paper presentation at ISPP 2020** /// Two months ago, my paper "Does Social Media Use Drive Partisan Polarization? Evidence from the 2017 German Federal Election Campaign" was accepted for this year's ISPP conference which was supposed to take place in July in Berlin. The organizers have decided to transform the event into a virtual conference. At first, I was hesitant to participate in the virtual event since I am quite skeptical that it is possible to profit from the virtual format in equal terms as from a physical meet-up. Yet, I have now decided to give it a try and will hold my presentation virtually.

*25/03/2020* /// **Paper accepted for ECREA 2020 in Braga** /// My paper "You Shall Know Them by Their Private Life? How (Inconsistent) Private Portrayals Affect the Evaluation of Populist Politicians", co-authored with Nora Denner (JGU Mainz), was accepted for presentation at this year's ECREA conference in Braga. Let's hope we will be able to present our work there in person in October.

*17/03/2020* /// **833k grant for project on Responsible News Recommender Systems (ReNewRS)** /// Together with Heiko Paulheim (web science, U Mannheim), Harald Sack (FIZ Karlsruhe), and Christof Weinhardt (business informatics, KIT Karlsruhe) I just received an 833k grant by *Baden-Württemberg-Stiftung* to investigate the effects of news recommender systems on opinion formation. The project will start later this year. Look out for our job openings. One of four PhDs will work under my supervision.

*11/03/2020* /// **Covid-19: Teaching will continue online** /// As of today, U Mannheim suspended all classes until the end of April. My teaching will continue online. I will provide online materials, exercises, and regular podcasts for my data analysis students and will try to organize my online experiment class using virtual meetings.

*10/02/2020* /// **Start of term** /// Today marks the start of term at U Mannheim. I will be teaching three classes: (1) *Statistics and Data Analysis with R* (BA), (2) *Advanced Data Analysis with R* (MA), and (3) *Online Experiment: Algorithmic Transparency* (BA).
