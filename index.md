## News

*16/11/2020* /// **Parental leave** /// As of today, I am on a five-month parental leave until April 2021. I am looking forward to the time I will be spending with my wonderful daughter and am deeply grateful for the opportunity to do so. In terms of teaching at U Mannheim, I am happy we were able to recruit <a href="https://mmckonel.github.io/" target="_blank">Mariel McKone Leonard</a> as my replacement. Our students will profit greatly from her tremendous methods expertise. For the time being, this website will only be updated occasionally.

*15/10/2020* /// **Grant from the German Bundestag's Racism Monitor** /// In the upcoming months, I will be involved in a project that is part of the German Bundestag's Racism Monitor program which is coordinated by *Deutsches Zentrum f체r Integrations- und Migrationsforschung*. My Mannheim-based colleagues Chung-hong Chan, Katharina Ludwig, Hartmut Wessler and I submitted a proposal to investigate open and hidden racism in German media coverage. We were asked to join forces with the team of Alejandro Ecker, Michael Imre, and Marius S채ltzer who proposed to study the same in the Twitter communication between politicians and citizens---which we happily did. We are looking forward to the collaboration, also with other project teams involved in the Racism Monitor who study similar questions.

*06/10/2020* /// **Teaching in the fall term** /// At U of Mannheim, the fall term 2020 started last week with a Corona-caused delay of four weeks. I will be giving three classes (mostly virtually): (1) *Introduction to Empirical Methods* together with Fabian Zimmermann and Mariel Leonard (who will also be my parental leave replacement as of November 15th), (2) *Statistics and Data Analysis with R*, and (3) *Right-Wing Populist Alternative Media on the Web*. I am looking forward to exploring different ways of virtual teaching for the first time and working with students again, even though, of course, I would prefer to see them in real life as soon as possible.

*14/08/2020* /// **"Fake news" lit review available in Spanish** /// Friedrich-Naumann-Stiftung commissioned me and Nora Denner (U Mainz) to write a literature review on prevalence and effects of and potential counter-measures against online disinformation in 2017. We updated the publication in 2019. Due to great demand, this second edition has now also been translated to Spanish language and marks my first ever Spanish-language publication. The Spanish version can be obtained <a href="https://shop.freiheit.org/#!/Publikation/911" target="_blank">here</a>.

*01/08/2020* /// **ReNewRS project started** /// Our project on *Responsible News Recommender Systems*, funded by *Baden-W체rttemberg-Stiftung*, and jointly conducted with colleagues from U Mannheim and KIT, has officially launched today. I am particularly happy to welcome Katharina Ludwig who will work with me on the project. For more information, please see <a href="https://www.phil.uni-mannheim.de/en/institute-for-media-and-comm/research/englisch-responsible-news-recommender-systems-renewrs/" target="_blank">here</a>.

*04/06/2020* /// **Chapter on populism in the news media published** /// Another publication from the very productive NCCR democracy project on populism in political communication has been published. In the chapter "Populist communication in the news media: The role of cultural and journalistic factors in ten democracies" we compare the occurrence of populist arguments in legacy news outlets of ten democracies and try to explain observable differences by cultural and journalistic factors. The chapter was published in a book by Christina Holtz-Bacha and Benjamin Kr채mer (*Perspectives on Populism and the Media*) which can be found <a href="https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/9783845297392/perspectives-on-populism-and-the-media" target="_blank">here</a>.
