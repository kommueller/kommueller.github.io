## News

*15/07/2022* /// **Academic colloquium in memory of Wolfram Peiser** /// Today, the Department of Communication Studies and Media Research at LMU Munich (where I obtained my PhD) hosted an academic colloquium in memory of Wolfram Peiser. Wolfram was my PhD advisor in Munich and had a major impact on my academic work and the way I approach topics and research questions. I had the honor of chairing the event which included talks by the likes of Klaus Schönbach (ZU Friedrichshafen/U Amsterdam), Christina Holtz-Bacha (FAU Erlangen-Nuremberg), or Carsten Reinemann (LMU Munich). I am still deeply saddened about the passing of Wolfram Peiser in June 2021. He was a master of structuring a field of study in a manageable way without losing any of its complexity, and of developing sophisticated research designs that were so beyond any doubt that they could not easily be challenged.  A commemorative volume entitled **Questions of Communication Change and Continuity** will appear later this year, edited by Benjamin Krämer (U Greifswald/LMU Munich) and myself. The book will be published by *Nomos* and will be available in an open-access version.

*07/04/2022* /// **New article out in Digital Journalism: Topic diversification and partisanship in the alternative news media market** /// In a study published today, Rainer Freudenthaler and I explored the content structures of German language alternative news media, with a special focus on two questions: 1.) Are right-wing populist partisanship (and ties to foreign countries and organizations) reflected in the outlets' content structures? (Short answer: right-wing populist partisanship clearly is, foreign relations are to some extent.) And: 2.) Is the alternative news market diversified with regards to content profiles? (Short answer: it is.) The full results are, of course, much more nuanced than these short answers. If you are interested in our analyses and their theoretical implications, feel free to read the article here: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/6GYZJWZZS5VRHDHWVZZT/full?target=10.1080/21670811.2022.2058972 " target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2022.2058972</a>

*01/02/2022* /// **New article out in NMS: The double-edged sword of online deliberation** /// A study I co-authored with Svenja Schäfer (U Vienna) & Marc Ziegele (HHU Düsseldorf) has just been published by *New Media and Society*. In this two-experiments open-access publication, we investigate the role evidence-based arguments within online debates play for discussion participation. Using mediation analysis, we can show that a higher argumentative quality of a given debate at the same time decreases and increases participation intent, resulting in a null total effect. This is due to the fact that evidence-based discussions strengthen participation via perceived knowledge and simultaneously buffer it via social comparison processes. If users read a high quality discussion they feel more knowledgable afterwards but at the same time inferior in comparison to the knowledge of others--which hinders an increase in willingness to participate. The full study can be found here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211073059" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211073059</a>

*13/01/2022* /// **ICA 2022 presentations** /// Two papers that I co-authored have been accepted for presentation at this year's ICA conference which is supposed to be held in Paris in May. Fingers crossed that this meeting will be held as an on-site event. Together with Katharina Ludwig (U Mannheim), Alexander Grote (KIT Karlsruhe), Andreea Iana (U Mannheim), Mehwish Alam (FIZ Karlsruhe), Heiko Paulheim (U Mannheim), Harald Sack (FIZ Karlsruhe), and Christof Weinhardt (KIT Karlsruhe) I studied "Recommended Polarization? The (Limited) Effects of Content- and Sentiment-Based News Recommendation on Affective, Ideological, and Perceived Polarization." The paper is a first outpot from our joint third-party funded project on *Responsible News Recommender Systems*. My second presentation comes from an all Mannheim-based project on *Open and Hidden Racism in the Mediated Public Sphere*. Together with Chung-hong Chan, Katharina Ludwig, Rainer Freudenthaler, and Hartmut Wessler I investigated "Differential Racism in the News: Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning to Distinguish Explicit and Implicit Stigmatization of Ethnic and Religious Groups in Journalistic Coverage." I am looking forward to present both papers in Paris.

*15/12/2021* /// **New project on implicit racism in news and social media** /// Together with Chung-hong Chan and Hartmut Wessler, I was just awarded a research grant by the German *Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ)* to study the occurrence and effects of implicit and explicit racism in news and social media. From 2022 to 2024, we will be working on the project together with postdoc Rainer Freudenthaler and PhD student Katharina Ludwig. Our research is embedded in the *Forschungsverbund Diskriminierung und Rassismus (FoDiRa)* that is lead by Andreas Blätte (U Duisburg-Essen) and Naika Foroutan (HU Berlin) and includes a variety of empirical projects on racial discrimination in different domains of the German society.
